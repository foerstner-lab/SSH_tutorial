** Introduction

The tool [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell][SSH]] (Secure Shell) can be used to connect to another computer
and execute programs there. The remote machine is often a server that
for example offer more computational power than you laptop. The most
widely used implemenation of SSH is [[http://www.openssh.com/][OpenSSH]].

** Basic usage

In order to connect to the remote machine you need to have an account
on it. In the following examples we assume that you have an account
called =alice= and a remote machine called =bobs_server= (Your name is
not Alice and you don't know any Bob? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob][Read this]] to understand the
choice of names).

You can connect to a remote machine and have an interactive session by
calling ssh like this (don't copy the =$= sign in any of the following
commands!):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh <your_username>@<server_name_or_ip>
#+END_EXAMPLE

In our example this would be

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh alice@bobs_server
#+END_EXAMPLE

SSH will presend you the host finger print

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Host key fingerprint is SHA256:ZwDBE5pV7SCqTXrHYzBChkhn3Nkx6cvvF9StX+W25No
+---[ECDSA 256]---+
|oo.o..B*+.       |
|o =. *++o .      |
| o  o..o.o  . .  |
|  . =  . ... . ..|
|   * +. S +   ...|
|  o o =o o . . .+|
|   . o ..   . +.o|
|         . .  .+ |
|        ...  ..E |
+----[SHA256]-----+
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first time your are connting to a remove machine you will be asked
to continue. Please type =yes= and press Enter.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
Warning: Permanently added 'hawaii' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then you will be asked for your password.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
alice@bobs_server's password:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Please enter your password and press Enter. Now you should have an
interactive shell session on the remote machine. You prompt might
indicate this but you can use =hostname= to make that you are on the
remote machine.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ hostname
bobs_server
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can disconnect by typing 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ exit
#+END_EXAMPLE

You will be informed that hte connection is closed
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Connection to bobs_server closed.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you can run commandline tools like on your local machine. If the
server is adequately configured you can even run tools with a
graphical interface (GUI) using so called X11-forwarding. For this
connect with ssh using the -X flag (disconnect first if you are
connected).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh -X alice@bobs_server
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can also run SSH non-interactively by calling it with a command to
execute:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh <your_username>@<server_name_or_ip> <command>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh alice@bobs_server ls
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will list the file in the home directory of the remote
machine. You will not have an interactive session on that machine but
will stay in the session of you local machine after the file list is
returned.

** Copying files with scp

Basic

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp <source> <target>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Folder

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp -r <source> <target>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Using compression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp -C <source> <target>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Using compression when sending

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp -rC <source> <target>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Examples. Be aware that =~/= represent your home directory on
GNU/Linux and the different BSD this is usually
=/home/your_username=. On OS X this is =/Users/your_username=. 

This will copy the file =my_local_big_file.txt= from your local
machine into your home directory of the remote machine.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp my_local_big_file.txt alice@bobs_server:~/
#+END_EXAMPLE

The following command will send the file to the server and rename it
to =my_remote_big_file.txt=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp my_local_big_file.txt alice@bobs_server:~/my_remote_big_file.txt
#+END_EXAMPLE

Sure you can use scp to copy from the server to you local machine:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp alice@bobs_server:/data/my_local_big_file.txt .
#+END_EXAMPLE


Note: scp is not the ideal tool. The developer of SSH [[https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.0][state]]: "The scp
protocol is outdated, inflexible and not readily fixed. We recommend
the use of more modern protocols like sftp and rsync for file transfer
instead." So rather use [[https://rsync.samba.org/][rsync]] [[https://linuxconfig.org/using-rsync-over-ssh-an-ultimate-backup-tool][over ssh]].


** Configure SSH

While you are now capable of working on the remote machine you have to
type a lot to connect to it. /Laziness is virtue/ - in the following
we will make working with SSH more convinient and reduce the need of
typing.

Create in the home directory of you local machine a folder called
=.ssh=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh
#+END_EXAMPLE

Make it unaccessible (read/write/executable) by other users:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ chmod -R go-rwx ~/.ssh
#+END_EXAMPLE

Create a configuration file

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ touch ~/.ssh/config
#+END_EXAMPLE

Open this configuration file in you favorite text editor (e.g. Emacs,
vi, nano, gedit) and add

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Host bobs
  User alice
  HostName bobs_server
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you can connect to the server simply by calling

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh bobs
#+END_EXAMPLE

or copy files without by using the short alias

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ scp my_file.txt bobs:~/
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Using SSH keys

Currently you have to type your password everytime you connect to the
remote machine. In order to avoid that we will generate once a so
called /SSH key pair/. A private key will be stored at your local
machine and should be *keep private*! The public key has to be put on
the server and can be liberately given away (e.g. a system
administrators might ask you for the public key in order to give you
access to a remote machine without any password). More details
regarding this public/private key approach can be found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography][here]].

Generate a key pair on your local machine. We use ~-b 4096~ in order
to generate a stronger key than with the default settings and ~-N ""~
to set no passphrase for the key. Generating the key can take a while.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -N ""
#+END_EXAMPLE

During the procedure you will be asked for the name of the key
file. Use the default by pressing Enter:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/your_local_user_name/.ssh/id_rsa):
Your identification has been saved in /home/your_local_user_name/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/your_local_user_name/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
0b:5c:b3:e8:51:d2:0e:3b:b8:cc:6d:97:4d:1d:e7:f0 your_local_user_name@your_local_machine
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 4096]----+
|                 |
|       .         |
|      o =   o .  |
|     o O o . *   |
|    . B S . . E  |
|   o + + =       |
|    + + + .      |
|     . .         |
|                 |
+-----------------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

As =ssh-keygen= reported we have now two files:

- Your private key file =/home/your_local_user_name/.ssh/id_rsa=
- Your public key file =/home/your_local_user_name/.ssh/id_rsa.pub=

Those are just plain test files and you can have a look at them using
=cat= or =less=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
#+END_EXAMPLE

We now want to copy the public key to the server. To set up a =.ssh=
folder on the server run the following command on your local machine:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh alice@bobs_server "mkdir -p ~/.ssh"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add the public key to the file (as you can see you can even pipe
commands into SSH) by running the following command on your local
machine:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cat ~/.ssh/*.pub | ssh alice@bobs_server 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
$ cat ~/.ssh/*.pub | ssh alice@bobs_server 'chmod 700 ~/.ssh'
$ cat ~/.ssh/*.pub | ssh alice@bobs_server 'chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add the private key to local SSH key-chain:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Persistent session with tmux

Alternatives:

-  nohub
-  screen

The terminal multiplexer [[https://tmux.github.io/][tmux]]

Start tmux for the first time

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ tmux
#+END_EXAMPLE

List sessions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ tmux list-sessions
#+END_EXAMPLE

Reconnect to running tmux sessions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ tmux attach
#+END_EXAMPLE

or simply

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ tmux a
#+END_EXAMPLE

Important keys:

- =Ctr-b c= - new window
- =Ctr-b ,= - rename window
- =Ctr-b x= - close window
- =Ctr-b <NUMBER>= - go to window with the given number 
- =Ctr-b [= - switch scrolling mode; use =q= to quit

List keys

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ tmux list-keys
#+END_EXAMPLE

List commands

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ tmux list-commands
#+END_EXAMPLE

Configure =~/.tmux.conf=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Change prefix to Control + o
set -g prefix C-o

# Increase history length
set -g history-limit 1000
#+END_EXAMPLE
